        """
        An instance of HashMap has two parameters that affect its performance: 
            initial capacity and load factor. The capacity is the number of 
            buckets in the hash table, and the initial capacity is simply the 
            capacity at the time the hash table is created. The load factor is 
            a measure of how full the hash table is allowed to get before its 
            capacity is automatically increased. When the number of entries in 
            the hash table exceeds the product of the load factor and the 
            current capacity, the hash table is rehashed (that is, internal data 
            structures are rebuilt) so that the hash table has approximately 
            twice the number of buckets.

        As a general rule, the default load factor (.75) offers a good tradeoff 
            between time and space costs. Higher values decrease the space 
            overhead but increase the lookup cost (reflected in most of the 
            operations of the HashMap class, including get and put). The 
            expected number of entries in the map and its load factor should 
            be taken into account when setting its initial capacity, so as to 
            minimize the number of rehash operations. If the initial capacity 
            is greater than the maximum number of entries divided by the load 
            factor, no rehash operations will ever occur.
